## Identity :
ASP.NET Core Identity was created to help with the security and management of users. It provides this abstraction layer between the application and the users/role data. We can use the API in itâ€™s entirety, or just bits and pieces as we need (such as the salting/hashing by itself) or email services. There is a lot of flexibility within ASP.NET Core Identity. We have the ability to take or leave whatever we want. Identity combines well with EFCore and SQL Server.
